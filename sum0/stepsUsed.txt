- create two folders: backend, client
- change directory and install using cmd line:
  npm init -y
  npm i mysql express nodemon
  if nodemon is unrecognised use 'npm install -g nodemon'
- create index.js file in backend, as it is main file in package json
- add type:'module' in package json
- add 'start':'nodemon index.js' so that nodemon starts directly and keeps updating...
- then create routes and respective operation needed to be done by them
- Now for getting json format from client, we need to add 'app.use(express.json())'
- now in client folder, use 'npx create-react-app .' to create react app in folder
- if error occurs as like no directory found, reinstall react using yarn or npm
- then open 'app.js' and import browserrouter
- now create a folder 'pages' to store react files for other functions
- type 'refce' to get snippet into it
- now open app.js and start
- install 'npm install axios' to send/recieve request/repsonse from react app
- now install 'cors' package in the backend
